          </p>

          <p class="eng_ans">
            The narrator describes three days of constant rain, during which
            several crabs entered the house and their bad smell impacted the
            newly born child, causing the child to get ill.

            encounter with in their courtyard.
          </p>

          <p class="eng_ans">
            Pelayo and his wife, Elisenda, discovered a strange elderly man in
            their yard dressed as a raga picker (a man who collects and sells
            rags). He had just a few pale hairs on his head and was in the
            horrible shape of a wet grandfather, his enormous barge wings
            half-fledged in the dirt and mud.

            c. Why did Pelayo and Elisenda imprison the old man in the chicken
            coop?
          </p>

          <p class="eng_ans">
            Pelayo and Elisenda imprisoned the old man in the chicken coop
            because they believed the old man was an angle who came here to take
            their children life.

            d. Why was Father Gonzaga not sure about the old man being a
            celestial messenger?

          <p class="eng_ans">
            Father Gonzaga was sure about the old man being a celestial
            messenger because, according to him, a celestial messenger should be
            able to speak and understand Latin, but the old man is unable to do
            so.

            Why do you think the crowd assembled to see him?

          <p class="eng_ans">
            Many people gathered to Pelayo's house to see the strange old guy
            because the old man had enormous wings, something no one had ever
            seen before.

          <p class="eng_ans">
            While the crowd gathered to view the strange man, the following
            miracles occurred: <br />
            (i) A blind guy who lost his sight but got three new teeth. <br />
            (ii) The paralytic who was unable to walk yet nearly won the
            lottery. <br />

            The following are some of the irritating things that people did to the strange old man: <br>
            (i) People pulled his feather. <br>
            (ii) Stones were thrown at him in order to get him to stand. <br>

          <p class="eng_ans">
            The women changed into spiders as a result of the lightning bolt of brimstone that came through the crack of the tow of the terrible thunderclap in the sky, and she was on her way to the dance without permission to dance and had disobeyed her parent.

          <p class="eng_ans">
            Elisenda was in the kitchen chopping vegetables for lunch when she noticed a gust of wind from the oceans and ran to the window, where she saw an angel making his first efforts at flight. He managed to keep his balance and make it through the remaining few homes, amazingly keeping himself up with the risky flapping of a senile vulture. She stared at him till she couldn't see him any more.
