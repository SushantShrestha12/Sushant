        <p class="eng_qsn">According to Josh Lanyon, "If there was one life skills everyone on the planet needed, it was the ability to think with critical objectivity." Justify this statement with your logic. </p>

        <div>

          <p class="eng_ans">
            Ans:-  
            Critical thinking is about judgment over whatever people have already done. Everyone thinks but not everyone thinks critically. <br> <br>

            According to Josh Lanyon, Not everyone has the ability to critically thinking but everyone should have it as a very important skill. In day-to-day life, people do their jobs, study, and do their regular stuff but they do not take the time for critical thinking they only do their important thing not knowing that critical thinking is also important to them. Critical thinking enhances their working skills, writing skills, etc. I do agree with Josh's statement, everyone has needed the ability to think critically. Only the writers have the high critical thinking ability but every individual should have the ability to think with critical objectivity because it helps them to sharpen their brainpower and they can do their work more effectively, more fluently, and in a faster way. <br> <br>

            Hence, In order to increase critical thinking ability, one should have to read the book, novels written by the famous people only then they can increase their critical thinking ability.
