        <p class="eng_qsn"> Critical Thinking</p>
        <p class="eng_qsn"> We see many elderly people in the elderly homes these days in Nepal. Some of them are abandoned while others live there willingly. Do you think Nepali people are deviating from their traditional culture? Give reason.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            Nepal is well-known for its traditional religion and culture. The elders carried down Nepalese culture from generation to generation. The elderly have a greater understanding and experience of Nepalese culture and tradition, whilst the youth do not. The old people of Nepal make many festivals possible, such as Dashain and Tihar. They have a better understanding of the rituals we perform in order to bring our celebration to an end using traditional culture. <br> <br>

            Elderly people are the monuments of unaging intellects, and their experiences are the doorway to family behavior, yet in today's culture, many senior people live in elderly homes rather than with their offspring. As individuals get older, many people abandon their parents and send them to senior homes. Senior adults are not only abandoned by their offspring, but some of them choose to live in elderly homes because of their children's lack of care and affection. As a result, our country's culture is at risk, and it may be forgotten and not recognized. People, in my opinion, are departing from their traditional culture. Since there will be no one left who knows about traditional culture once all of the old have been placed in senior homes. <br> <br>

            As a result, we must respect and care for our parents, even if they are elderly, so that they can pass on their cultural knowledge to us. If our culture is gone, our country may become unknown.
