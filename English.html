        <h1 class="q1"> &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  Critical thinking</h1> <br>
        <h1 class="q11">b.  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; According to Josh Lanyon, “If there was one life skill everyone on the planet 
          needed, it was the ability to think with critical objectivity.” Justify this statement 
          with your logic.</h1> <br>

        <button class="all_button" onclick="toggleClock13()" id="clockButton13">Show</button>

        <div class="display_btn" id="myDIV13">

          <p class="ans1">
            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Critical thinking is about judgment over whatever people have already done. Everyone thinks but, not everyone thinks critically. <br> <br>

            According to josh, not everyone has the ability to critically thinking but, everyone should have it as a very important life skill. In day-to-day life people do their jobs, study, and do their regular kinds of stuff but, they do not take their time for critical thinking. They only do their important thing not knowing that critical thinking is also important to them. I do agree with josh's statement, Everyone has needed the ability to think critically. Only the writers have the high critical ability but every individual should have the ability to sharpen their brain power and they can do their work more effectively, more fluently, and in a faster way. <br> <br>
            
            Hence, In order to increase critical thinking ability, one should have to read the book, novels written by the famous people only then they can increase their critical thinking ability.
