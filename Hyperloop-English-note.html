          Answer these questions. <br />
          a. What is Hyperloop? How does it work?
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            A hyperloop is an ultra-high speed ground transportation system for
            passenger and cargo. It work by 'floating' pod which shoots through
            giant, low-pressure tubes either above or below ground.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="eng_qsn"></p>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
          b. How is hyperloop more beneficial than the traditional trains?
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            Hyperloop is more beneficial than the traditional train because it
            is faster, cheaper, and less polluting than traditional train.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="eng_qsn">c. Does hyperloop have a successful history? How?</p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            No, hyperloop doesnot have a successful history because it is still
            in under experimentation since 1864.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="eng_qsn">
          d. Write the contribution of Robert Goddard and Elon Musk for the
          development of hyperloop.
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            The contribution of Robert Goddard is that he developed 'vactrain'
            and Elon Musk contribution is 'Hyperloop alpha'.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="eng_qsn">
          e. What relation does speed have with air resistance? Explain.
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            The relation, speed have with air resistance is that when air
            resistance decreases speed incresases and when air resistance
            increases speed decreases.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="eng_qsn">
          f. What are hyperloop capsules compared with? How are they similar?
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            The hyperloop capsules are compared with air hockey game. They are
            similar because hyperloop floats above the tube's surface similarly,
            the puck floats just above the table on an air hockey game.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="eng_qsn">
          g. How do the passengers feel while travelling via hyperloop? What
          will be done to make it luxurious?
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            While travelling via hyperloop the passenger might feels
            uncomfortable due to nausea including acceleration, plus lateral
            G-force on bends in the route. It will be lucurious by showing
            passengers beautiful landscape in the cabin.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="eng_qsn">
          h. Why does the writer doubt about the success of hyperloop? What does
          the success depend on?
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            Since 1864 hyperloop is still under experimentation and capacity is
            also another issue so, writer doubts about the success of hyperloop.
            The success depends on the destination, local, economic and
            geography.

          Critical thinking <br />
          b. The number of private vehicle is increasing day by day in Nepal
          beyond the capacity of our infrastructure. What do you think should be
          done to curb the ever-growing number of private vehicles? Discuss.
        </p>

        <div>
          <p class="eng_ans">
            In Nepal, the number of private vehicle is expanding on a daily
            basis, to the point where there are more private vehicles than
            intented or necessary. People in the middle class and upper class
            are buying automobiles, which increases the number of private
            vehicles. Private vehicles not only have an impact on environment,
            but they may also have an impact on our health, causing diseases
            such as cancer, lungs problem, and difficulty in breathing. There
            are so many private automobiles that there is no space for a
            footpath. Since, people are parking their cars on the sidewalk.
            <br />
            <br />

            Private automobiles are more expensive than public vehicles to the
            general public, their usage should be reduced as much as possible.
            Instead of utilizing private vehicles, we should utilize public
            vehicles, which are also less expansive. Electric vehicles are
            another option for both private and public transportation. Electric
            vehicles are powered by electricity rather than gasoline or diesal.
            Because an electric car is powered by electricity, there is no smoke
            or polluntants to harm our health or the environment. Electric
            automobiles, such as Tesla, are prohibitively expensive for the
            middle class. As a result, it is preferable to use public
            transportation rather than a private automobile or an electric cars.
            <br />
            <br />

            So, In order to reduce the ever-increasing number of private
            automobiles, using public transportation is the greatest option for
            us, the environment, animals, and so on.
