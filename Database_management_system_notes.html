          The processed form of data is called information. In general sense,
          it is processed, organized, and structured data. It provides context
          for data and enables decision making. <br />
          <br />
          Information can be transmitted in time, via data storage, and space,
          via communication and telecommunication. It can be transferred
          through telephone, text messages and from various sources.
          Information is expressed either as the content of a message or
          through direct or indirect observation. That, which is perceived can
          be constructed as a message in its own right, and in the sense,
          information is always conveyed as the context of a message. <br />
          <br />

          Hence, the collection of data is known as information where data are
          organized in such a way that it creates meaning when it becomes
          information.

          puts data into tabular form, removing duplicated data from the relation tables. <br> <br>

          Normalization entails organizing the columns and tables of a database to ensure that their depnedicies are
          prperly enforced by database integrity constrains. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by
          a process of synthesis or decomposition.
