        <p class="eng_qsn">
          Answer the following questions. <br />
          a. Why was Mrs. Baroda unhappy with the information about Governail's visit to their farm?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
          Mrs. Baroda was unhappy with the information of Governail's visit to their farm since he was a guy about whom she had heard a lot, and she was prepared to rest and relax in order to spend some time with her husband.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
          b. How was Governail different from Mrs. Barada's expectation?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
          Mrs. Baroda expected Governail to be tall, thin, cynical, with eyeglasses and his hands in his pockets, but in actuality, Governail was slim enough, but neither tall or cynical; he also didn't wear eyeglasses or have his hands in his pockets.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
          c. How does Mrs. Baroda compare Gavernail with her husband?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
          Mrs. Baroda finds Governail appealing, calm, and endearing. She doesn't regard him as having the same qualities as her husband. She was unable to find any of the brilliant and promising qualities that Gaston, her husband, had repeatedly informed her he possessed in him. Mrs. Baroda considers him unsocialable in compared to her husband since he does not appear to be paying attention to her.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
          d. Why and how did Mrs. Baroda try to change Governail's Solitary habits?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
          Mrs. Baroda attempted to change Governail's Solitary habits because she expected him to be more interesting, he was no longer interested in facts, and she did not expect a commotion over his presence, and she attempted to change her Solitary - by being more adaptable to situations, and by requesting his husband.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
          e. How does Graston disagree with his wife on Governail's
          character?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
          Gaston disagrees with his wife on the character of Governail since Governail was not a nice or interesting guy.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
          f. Why is Gaston surprised with his wife's expression towards the end of the story?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
          Gaston was surprised by his wife's attitude near the end of the story since she offered, entirely on her own idea, that Governail visit them again.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
          Reference to the context <br>
          a. what is the cause of contict in Mrs. Baroda's mind?
          What role does Mrs. Baroda 'being a respectable woman'
          play in the story?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
          Mrs. Baroda's main cause of conflict is her attraction to her husband's friend. Mrs. Baroda wants to tell Gaston about her strange mistake, but she realizes rationally that she must tackle this feeling on her own and defend her pride in being a woman.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
          b. Sketch the character of Governail and contrast it with Gaston.
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
          Governail is Gaston's "collage friend," a journalist in the present, "in no sense a society guy" or "a man about town," and a smoker, according to the exterior characterisation.
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
          The last three sentence of the story bring a kind of twist After reading three Sentences, how do you analyze Mrs. Baroda's attitude towards Governail?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
          The story's final three phrases include a twist.
          In the following three sentences, the tale has presented an unanticipated alteration in Mrs. Baroda's internal description and perspective. Mrs. Baroda's view on governance has shifted, and she is no longer bound by society's definition of what constitutes a decent lady. Mrs. Baroda has achieved success outside of the confines of society. We may anticipate that Mrs. Baroda has not only overcome her own and society's perceptions of what a proper woman is, but she is also willing to pursue a connection with Governail, saying Gaston, "I shall be extremely pleasant to him."
