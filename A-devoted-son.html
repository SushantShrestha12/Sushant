          Answer the following questions. <br />
          a. How did the morning papers bring ambiance of celebration in the varma family?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            The morning paper brought ambiance of celebration
            in the Varma family with the joyous news of Rakesh's
            achievement in his academic life. It contained the
            news of Rakesh's highest pass mark in the whole
            country.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
            b. How did the Community Celebrate Rakesh's success?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            Rakesh's achievement is celebrated by the community by presenting the tiny yellow house at the end of the rood to congratulate the parents of this Wunderkind, to pat Rakesh on the back, and to fill the house and garden with the sounds and colors of a celebration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
           c. Why was Rakeshis success a special matter of
            discussion in the neighbourhood?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            Rakesh's success was a topic of conversation in the neighborhood because he was the family's first son to get a higher education and pass the Medical Exam.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">

            "America" and.
            "the USA"?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            The author makes fun of the terms 'America' and 'the USA' by saying that Rakesh's father is unaware that both America and the USA are similar, thus he taught everyone in the home to say America but not the USA.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
            e. How does the author characterize Rakesh's wife?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            Rakesh's wife is characterized by the book as an old-fashioned, ignorant, fat woman. She was lazy, placid, and complaisant, but she was too nice to even try to force Rakesh to leave the house and sit up on his own.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
            f. Describe how Rakesh rises in his career.
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            Rakesh began his work in the city hospital, quickly climbing to the top of the administrative hierarchy and becoming a director before leaving to open his own clinic.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
           g. How does the author describe Rakesh's family
            background?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            The author describes Rakesh's family background as a guy born to illiterate parents, his father working as a kerosene trader, his mother working in a kitchen, and his grandfather working as a vegetable seller.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
            h. What is the impact of Rakesh's mother's death
            on his father?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            Rakesh's father died of a mystery disease called a peevish whim, and his father was grieved by the death of his wife as well as retirement.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
            i. What did Rakech do to make his father's old age
            more comfortable?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            Rakesh brought his father morning tea in one of the china cups from the old man's favorite brass tumbler and set it at the side of his father's bed, comfortable and relaxed his father's nightshirt, and discussed or rather, read out the morning news to his father.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
            j. Why did the old man try to bribe his grand-children?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            The old guy attempts to bribe his grandchildren because he wants to eat jalebi, but his son forbids him from eating fried or sweet foods.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="eng_qsn">
            k. Are Mr. Varma's complains about his diets resonable?
            How?
        </p>

        <p class="eng_ans">
            Yes, in my opinion. Mr. Varma's concerns about his diets are responsible, Rakesh is a professional doctor as well as a loyal and obedient son, doctor entitled to performance and activities since he conducts such activities to keep his father healthy and to improve his father's life.
