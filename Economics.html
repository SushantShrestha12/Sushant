        <div>

          <p class="ans1">
            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Human wants are unlimited but resources are limited and those resources are supplied in less amount than the demand. It is known as Scarcity.
          </p>

        </div>

        <h1 class="q1"> Choice </h1> 

        <div>

          <p class="ans1">
            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Choice refers to the ability of a consumer or producer to decide which good, service, or resource to purchase or provide from a range of possible options.
          </p>

        </div>


        <h1 class="q1">Q NO.1  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Scarcity is the central problem of the economy. Justify this statement.</h1>


        <div>

          <p class="ans1">
            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Human wants are unlimited, but the resources are limited and those resources are supplied in less amount than the demand. It is known as Scarcity. <br> <br>
          
            Scarcity is the central problem of the economy because while resources are limited, we are living in a society with unlimited wants. Therefore we have to choose. We have to make trade-offs. We have to effectively allocate resources. We have to do these things because resources are limited and cannot meet our own unlimited demands. People are creating unlimited demands, but there is less supply than demand so, that's why scarcity is the central problem of the economy. People have a choice to choose the resources which are available.  <br> <br>
            
            In conclusion, Scarcity is the main problem of the economy because we have to choose the limited resources over the unlimited wants.

            <p class="ans1">This figure shows that the x-axis measures consumer goods and the y-axis measures capital goods. In order to increase the production of one unit, more and more units of other goods have to be sacrificed since the resources are limited and are not equally efficient in the production of both the goods.

            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The market economy is also known as a capitalist economy or free enterprise economy. In a market economy, all economic activities like production, consumption, distribution, exchange, etc are organized and carried out by private sectors and guided by profit motive through the market forces - demand and supply.  <br> <br>

            Market forces determine what to produce, how to produce, and whom to produce. Demand or supply of resources determines their respective share in total income. Similarly, demand for and supply of goods and services determine the equilibrium price and quantity in the market. There is no extra tax or subsidy on goods and services. Consumers are free to decide their consumption or saving. There is no control over consumption level from the side of the government. Individuals can conduct international trade themselves. There is no control over export and import. The private sector is the backbone of economic development. 
 <br> <br>

            Hence, Government is the monitor and supervisor of the economy, US, UK, Japan, Germany are the example of a market economy.
