        <h1 class="q1">Q NO.1  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Scarcity is the central problem of economy. Justify this statement.</h1>

        <button class="all_button" onclick="toggleClock3()" id="clockButton3">Show answer</button>

        <div class="display_btn" id="myDIV3">

          <p class="ans1">
            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;Human wants are unlimited, but the resources are limited and those resources are supplied in less amount than the demand. It is known as Scarcity. <br> <br>
          
            Scarcity is the central problem of the economy because while resources are limited, we are living in a society with unlimited wants. Therefore we have to choose. We have to make trade-offs. We have to effectively allocate resources. We have to do these things because resources are limited and cannot meet out own unlimited demands. People are creating unlimited demands, but there is less supply than the demand so, that's why scarcity is the central problem of economy. People have choice to choose the resources which are avaliable. <br> <br>
            
            In conclusion, Scarcity is the main problem of economy because we have to choose the limited resources over the unlimited wants.

            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Human wants are unlimited but resources are available to fulfill those wants are limited, they have alternative uses.

          <p class="ans1">Production possibility curve refers to locus focus of various alternative combinations of two commodities that can be produced utilizing the available means and resources and given technology by an economy in a certain time period</p>

Combination D(3, 4) shows 3 MT consumer goods and 4 MT capital goods.  Combination E(4, 0) shows 4 MT consumer goods and 0 MT capital goods.

            <h1 class="q1"> Diagram </h1> 

            <div id="chartContainer"></div>

            <p class="ans1">This figure shows that the x-axis measures consumer goods and the y-axis measures capital goods. In order to increase the production of one unit, more and more units of other goods have to be sacrificed since the resources are limited and are not equally efficient in the production of both the goods. 
            </p>

            <h1 class="q1"> Conclusion </h1> 
            <p class="ans1">Hence, the resources are limited in order to increase the production of one good to the producer should have to sacrifice the production of other goods. The more unit of one commodity the more sacrifice of another commodity.</p>
