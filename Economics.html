            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Human wants are unlimited but resources are limited and those resources are supplied in less amount than the demand. It is known as Scarcity.

          <p class="eco_ans">
            Ans:- &nbsp; Human wants are unlimited, but the resources are limited and those resources are supplied in less amount than the demand. It is known as Scarcity. <br> <br>
          
            Scarcity is the central problem of the economy because while resources are limited, we are living in a society with unlimited wants. Therefore we have to choose. We have to make trade-offs. We have to effectively allocate resources. We have to do these things because resources are limited and cannot meet our own unlimited demands. People are creating unlimited demands, but there is less supply than demand so, that's why scarcity is the central problem of the economy. People have a choice to choose the resources which are available.  <br> <br>
            
            In conclusion, Scarcity is the main problem of the economy because we have to choose the limited resources over the unlimited wants.

            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  The market economy is also known as a capitalist economy or free enterprise economy. In a market economy, all economic activities like production, consumption, distribution, exchange, etc are organized and carried out by private sectors and guided by profit motive through the market forces - demand and supply.  <br> <br>

            Market forces determine what to produce, how to produce, and whom to produce. Demand or supply of resources determines their respective share in total income. Similarly, demand for and supply of goods and services determine the equilibrium price and quantity in the market. There is no extra tax or subsidy on goods and services. Consumers are free to decide their consumption or saving. There is no control over consumption level from the side of the government. Individuals can conduct international trade themselves. There is no control over export and import. The private sector is the backbone of economic development. 
 <br> <br>

            Hence, Government is the monitor and supervisor of the economy, US, UK, Japan, Germany are the example of a market economy.

          <p class="eco_ans">
            Ans:-  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; An economy in which all the economic activities are carried out by the central government for public welfare is called a command economy. A socialist economy is also known as a controlled economy or planned economy. In a socialist economy, resources are controlled by the state or government through the central planner. 
            <br> <br>

            In a socialist economy, all the wages, rent, interests, and profit are fixed by the government. The government decides what to produce, how to produce, and whom to produce. There is no existence of private property. In this economy, people are not guided by self-interest. They are guided by the interest of the nation. All the prices are set by the government since there is no private sector. 

            <br> <br>

            Hence, consumers are not free to choose goods and services for consumption. The government manages all economic activities. Some of the examples of socialist economies are North Korea, China, and the Former Soviet Union.

            A mixed economy consists of both features of a socialist economy as well as a capitalist economy. Both government and private sector work together in this mixed economy. Major roles of the government are: providing security, supplying money, maintaining law and order, developing infrastructure, and so on. The private sectors are free to do their activities under the rules and regulations of the government. 
            <br> <br>

            Hence, production and distribution are managed and controlled by private sectors for the purpose of self-interest and profit earnings. The government sector prepares and implements policy instruments to control and regulate private enterprises directly and indirectly. Some of the examples of mixed economies are Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc.
